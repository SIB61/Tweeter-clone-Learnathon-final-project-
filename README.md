# Twitter-Clone

# Project Title: Twitter Clone (Web Application)
# Project Overview: 
Led the development of a web application that emulated the core functionalities of Twitter, a popular social media platform. Designed and implemented a user-friendly and scalable platform allowing users to post tweets, follow others, like and retweet posts, comment on posts, perform searches, and receive real-time notifications.
Your role / responsibility： 
Took charge of back-end development using C# and applied the unit of work and repository patterns with Dotnet Web API. Architected the back-end infrastructure, integrating technologies like Redis for caching and RabbitMQ for message queuing. Collaborated closely with the front-end developer to ensure seamless implementation of key features such as tweets, retweets, likes, comments, search, and real-time notifications.

# Total Number of Members：
The project was completed by a two-member team, consisting of myself and another team member. We both had specific responsibilities, with my focus on the back-end development and the other team member handling the front-end development. Together, we successfully delivered a high-quality Twitter Clone application that met the project objectives.
